                Visual Studio Code, also called VS code is an app where you can create websites using HTML (HyperText Markup Language), CSS (Cascading StyleSheet), and JS (JavaScript). Visual Studio Code was first announced on April 29, 2015, by Microsoft at the 2015 Build conference. A preview build was released shortly thereafter. On November 18, 2015, the source of Visual Studio Code was released under the MIT License and made available on GitHub. Extension support was also announced. To set up Visual Studio Code, you first have to download and install VS Code. You then have to create a new folder in your computer and then click on "open folder" and select the folder you have created. You then have to do a right click on the empty place on the screen which is below the name of the folder you opened in VS Code, and then there will be an option as "New File" which you have to click. After clicking on the option, you need to type "index.html" or any other building blocks of the web. After you're ready with the code, you can click on "Go Live" in the bottom of the screen to check out the results of your website. After you're done with everything, you can save all your work and if you want to host your website for free, you can further do it on GitHub.
